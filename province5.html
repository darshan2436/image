    <p>Lumbini Province (Nepali: लुम्बिनी प्रदेश, romanized: Lumbinī pradēśa) is a province in western Nepal. The country's third largest province in terms of area as well as population, Lumbini is home to the World Heritage Site of Lumbini, where according to the Buddhist tradition, the founder of Buddhism, Gautama Buddha was born.[1]

        Lumbini borders Gandaki Province and Karnali Province to the north, Sudurpashchim Province to the west, and Uttar Pradesh and Bihar of India to the south. Lumbini's capital, Deukhuri, is near the geographic center of the province; it is a small town which is currently being developed to meet the prerequisite of a provincial capital. The major cities in the province are Butwal and Siddharthanagar in Rupandehi district, Nepalgunj in Banke district, Tansen in Palpa district, and Ghorahi and Tulsipur in Dang district.</p>
